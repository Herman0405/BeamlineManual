# BMM Beamline Manual

Compiled doucument at
https://nsls-ii-bmm.github.io/BeamlineManual/

The *docs/* folder contains the sphinx source of the manual. 

This repository is instrumented to use Github Actions to compile the
sphinx text to HTML automatically when pushed.  So the manual should
always be as up to date as possible.

This documentation project uses the lovely
[{book}theme](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
from the [The Executable Book Project](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/).
