To Do List
==========

This is an aggregate list of things missing from the BMM beamline
documentation manual.

#. Document pseudo channel cut & fixed exit DCM modes
#. Document use of ``XDI_record`` to control what motors get recorded
   in the XDI header


This is an aggregate list of things mentioned in this document that
the BMM data collection system needs to do.

#. Better sanity checking on linescan input
#. Better sanity checking on areascan input
#. Have database consume snapshots
#. Mode C lookup table
#. Lookup table for E < 8 keV at goniometer
#. Look up E0 from element & edge, use E0 to specify a non-edge energy
#. Better sanitizing of INI file input
#. Better heuristics for scan time remaining
